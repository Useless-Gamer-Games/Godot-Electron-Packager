packages electron for windows and linux.
open with godot 4 for source code and the scene is 2d.
To use the app 
in the first box, put your project name and in the second box, put the path to your project witha \ on the end.
Then click the operating system and wait.
The app may freeze, thats because it is running commands so just give it a second before you close the app and when it stops freezing, it will create your built app in the dist folder.
